--------------------------(host & port two arguments for Socket)---------------------------


Picking a local interface to connect from:

Java provides a way of specifying:
1. Local interface, local port to connect from.
2. Remote interface (host), remote port to connect to.

This is used when a specific device has two or more than two interface routers.(Eg. routers- has two ethernet ports)

Constructor Syntax:

public Socket(InetAddress host, int port, InetAddress localAddr, int localPort)

*******Constructing without connecting**********
- We can construct a socket initially and then connect later according to our need.
- This helps in flexible socket management.
  Example:
  Socket socket = new Socket();
  SocketAddress address = new InetSocketAddress("host",port);
  Socket.connect(address);

*********Socket Address**********
1. Retrieving SocketAddress
   Constructors:
   public SocketAddress getRemoteSocketAddress; -----> returns the remote system address.
   public SocketAddress getLocalSocketAddress; -----> returns the local machine's address.
   
2. Connecting to a server
   Socket socket = new Socket();
   SocketAddress yahoo = new InetSocketAddress("www.yahoo.com",po);
   socket.close();

   Socket socket2 = new Socket();
   socket2.connect(yahoo);


********Proxy Server***********
   Bypassing proxy server:
   Socket socket = new Socket(Proxy.NO_PROXY);

   Types of proxy servers:
1. Proxy.Types.Socks ----> used at the transport layer.
2. Proxy.Types.HTTP ----> used at the application layer.
3. Proxy.Types.DIRECT ----> no proxy, direct communication.
